Here we showcase Curie's performance on some common MLSys questions. 

### Q1: How does reducing the number of sampling steps affect the inference time of a pre-trained diffusion model on MNIST? What is the relationship between them (linear or sub-linear)?

```bash
python3 -m curie.main -f benchmark/junior_mlsys_engineer_bench/q1_diffusion_step.txt 
```
