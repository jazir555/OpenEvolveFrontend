# Packing Circles in Unit Square Example

This example demonstrates how to use the **LoongFlow** framework to solve a computational geometry optimization problem. The goal is to evolve a Python algorithm that finds a specific configuration of circles in a confined space.

## Problem Description

The objective is to find a configuration of $n=26$ disjoint circles within a unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ that maximizes the sum of their radii.

For the problem context and similar results, please refer to the official repository:
**[AlphaEvolve Results Repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/packing_circles_max_sum_of_radii/packing_circle_max_sum_of_radii.ipynb)**

In this specific configuration ($n=26$), we aim to exceed the known baseline sum of radii.

## Project Structure

- **`initial_program.py`**: The starting seed code. It contains a basic function signature `construct_packing` and a structured implementation (placeholder) that needs to be evolved.
- **`eval_program.py`**: The evaluation logic. It executes the generated code in a secure/isolated manner, verifies geometric constraints (distinct circles, boundary limits), and calculates the score based on the sum of radii.
- **`task_config.yaml`**: The main configuration file defining the LLM prompt, evolution parameters (iterations, target score), and the agent components (Planner, Executor, Summarizer).

## How to Run

To start the evolution process, you need to use the `math_agent_agent.py` entry point. Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` includes the project root so that python can find the `agents` and `evolux` modules.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you are in the root directory of your local project (the directory containing `agents/` and `evolux/`).

### 2. Execution Command

Run the following command to kick off the evolution. This command loads the base configuration and injects the initial code and evaluation logic from the respective files.

```bash
python agents/math_agent/math_agent_agent.py \
  --config agents/math_agent/examples/packing_circle_in_unit_square/task_config.yaml \
  --initial-file agents/math_agent/examples/packing_circle_in_unit_square/initial_program.py \
  --eval-file agents/math_agent/examples/packing_circle_in_unit_square/eval_program.py \
  --log-level INFO
```

**Arguments Explanation:**

- `--config`: Path to the YAML configuration file (`task_config.yaml`).
- `--initial-file`: Path to the Python file containing the seed code (`initial_program.py`). The content of this file will be injected into `evolve.initial_code`.
- `--eval-file`: Path to the Python file containing the evaluation logic (`eval_program.py`). The content will be injected into `evolve.evaluator.evaluate_code`.
- `--log-level`: Sets the logging verbosity (e.g., INFO, DEBUG).

### 3. Configuration Highlights

The `task_config.yaml` is pre-configured with the following strategies:

- **Planner**: `evolve_planner` (Handles the strategic direction of code modification).
- **Executor**: `evolve_executor_fuse` (A powerful executor that fuses multiple thought processes/candidates).
- **Summarizer**: `evolve_summary` (Summarizes the results of the execution for the next iteration).
- **Target**: The evolution aims for a target score of `1.0` (normalized against the baseline).

## Evolution Process & Results

The system iterates through generations of code, attempting to maximize the sum of radii for $n=26$ circles. Below are the visualizations of the generated packing configurations at different stages of the evolution.

### Final Result

The best solution found by LoongFlow.

**Result Metrics:**

- **Sum of Radii:** 2.63596324918732 (Exceeds reference baseline: 2.6358627564136983)

## Troubleshooting

- **TimeoutError**: The `eval_program.py` enforces a strict timeout (default 3600s in config, though internal function calls have shorter timeouts). If the generated code enters an infinite loop, it will be terminated and marked as a failure.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. You may need to run `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.` in the project root before running the command.
