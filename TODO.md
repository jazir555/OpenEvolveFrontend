# Sovereign-Grade Decomposition Workflow - Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the workflow detailed in `SOVEREIGN_GRADE_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md`.

## Phase 1: Core Structures & Configuration UI

- [x] Create `workflow_structures.py` to define core data objects (Team, GauntletDefinition, etc.).
- [x] Create `team_manager.py` to handle the logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Teams.
- [x] Create `gauntlet_manager.py` to handle the logic for managing Gauntlet definitions.
- [x] Create `ui_components.py` to house the Streamlit UI components for the Team Manager and Gauntlet Designer.
- [x] Modify `openevolve_orchestrator.py` to integrate the new UI components for team and gauntlet management under the "Configuration" tab.

## Phase 2: Workflow Engine Implementation

- [x] Create `workflow_engine.py` to house the core execution functions.
- [x] Implement `run_gauntlet()` function in `workflow_engine.py`. This is a critical function that will interpret a `GauntletDefinition` and execute it with a given `Team`.
- [x] Implement `run_content_analysis()` function in `workflow_engine.py`.
- [x] Implement `run_ai_decomposition()` function in `workflow_engine.py`.
- [x] Implement the main `run_sovereign_workflow()` orchestrator function in `workflow_engine.py`. This function will manage the state and transitions for the entire workflow (Stages 0-5).

## Phase 3: UI & Workflow Integration

- [x] Modify `openevolve_orchestrator.py`:
    - [x] Add the "Sovereign-Grade Decomposition Workflow" to the list of available workflow types.
    - [x] Create the UI for configuring a new workflow, including dropdowns to select pre-configured Teams and Gauntlets for each stage.
    - [x] Implement the "Manual Review" panel. This UI must render the `DecompositionPlan` and allow the user to edit and approve it, which requires careful state management.
- [x] Implement the real-time monitoring view for the workflow's progress.
- [ ] Connect the "Start Workflow" button to the `run_sovereign_workflow()` function in the `workflow_engine.py`.

## Phase 4: Finalization & Self-Healing

- [x] Implement the "Self-Healing" loop logic within the `run_sovereign_workflow` function, including the targeted feedback parsing and recursive re-solving of flawed sub-problems.
- [ ] Conduct a full review of all new code, adding detailed docstrings and comments.
- [ ] Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together as described in the design document.
- [ ] Remove any remaining placeholder code and finalize the implementation.
