"""
Comprehensive integration tests for the Sovereign-Grade Decomposition Workflow.

These tests aim to verify the end-to-end functionality of the workflow,
including UI interactions, team and gauntlet management, content analysis,
AI-assisted decomposition, manual review, sub-problem solving (with self-healing),
reassembly, and final verification.

Due to the interactive nature of Streamlit and the reliance on external LLM APIs,
these tests are designed to be run manually or with specialized UI testing frameworks
(e.g., Playwright, Selenium) that can interact with a running Streamlit application.

This file serves as a placeholder and guide for setting up such tests.
