# Heilbronn Problem for Convex Regions Example

This example demonstrates how to use the **LoongFlow** framework to solve a challenging computational geometry optimization problem. The goal is to evolve a Python algorithm that finds a specific configuration of points within a unit square.

## Problem Description

The objective is to place $n$ points in a unit square $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ such that the minimum area of any triangle formed by three of these points is maximized. This is a variation of the classical Heilbronn triangle problem.

For the detailed mathematical definition and problem context, please refer to the official AlphaEvolve problem description:
**[Heilbronn Problem Results](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_results/tree/main)**

In this specific configuration ($n=13$), we aim to maximize the minimum triangle area.

## Project Structure

- **`initial_program.py`**: The starting seed code. It contains a basic function signature `find_best_placement` and a simulated annealing implementation that needs to be evolved.
- **`eval_program.py`**: The evaluation logic. It executes the generated code in a secure/isolated manner, verifies geometric constraints (distinct points, non-collinear, inside unit square), and calculates the score based on the target area.
- **`task_config.yaml`**: The main configuration file defining the LLM prompt, evolution parameters (iterations, target score), and the agent components (Planner, Executor, Summarizer).

## How to Run

To start the evolution process, you need to use the `math_agent_agent.py` entry point. Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` includes the project root so that python can find the `agents` and `evolux` modules.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you are in the root directory of your local project (the directory containing `agents/` and `evolux/`).

### 2. Execution Command

Run the following command to kick off the evolution. This command loads the base configuration and injects the initial code and evaluation logic from the respective files.

```bash
python agents/math_agent/math_agent_agent.py \
  --config agents/math_agent/examples/heilbronn_problem_for_convex_regions/task_config.yaml \
  --initial-file agents/math_agent/examples/heilbronn_problem_for_convex_regions/initial_program.py \
  --eval-file agents/math_agent/examples/heilbronn_problem_for_convex_regions/eval_program.py \
  --log-level INFO
```

**Arguments Explanation:**

- `--config`: Path to the YAML configuration file (`task_config.yaml`).
- `--initial-file`: Path to the Python file containing the seed code (`initial_program.py`). The content of this file will be injected into `evolve.initial_code`.
- `--eval-file`: Path to the Python file containing the evaluation logic (`eval_program.py`). The content will be injected into `evolve.evaluator.evaluate_code`.
- `--log-level`: Sets the logging verbosity (e.g., INFO, DEBUG).

### 3. Configuration Highlights

The `task_config.yaml` is pre-configured with the following strategies:

- **Planner**: `evolve_planner` (Handles the strategic direction of code modification).
- **Executor**: `evolve_executor_fuse` (A powerful executor that fuses multiple thought processes/candidates).
- **Summarizer**: `evolve_summary` (Summarizes the results of the execution for the next iteration).
- **Target**: The evolution aims for a target score of `1.0` (normalized against the benchmark area).

## Evolution Process & Results

The system iterates through generations of code, attempting to maximize the minimum triangle area.

### Final Result

The best solution found by LoongFlow achieved a minimum area of **0.030900663674639613**, surpassing the previous SOTA benchmark of 0.0306.

**Result Metrics:**

- **Optimized Minimum Area ($n=13$):** 0.03090066

## Troubleshooting

- **TimeoutError**: The `eval_program.py` enforces a strict timeout (default 3600s in config, though internal function calls have shorter timeouts). If the generated code enters an infinite loop, it will be terminated and marked as a failure.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. You may need to run `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.` in the project root before running the command.
