# OpenEvolve Deeper Integration Plan

## Phase 1: Enhanced Control & Feedback

1.  **Expose more OpenEvolve parameters in the UI:**
    *   Identify key configurable parameters in `openevolve_integration.py` and `evolution.py` (e.g., population size, number of generations, mutation rate, crossover rate, selection method).
    *   Add UI elements (sliders, input fields, dropdowns) in `main.py` or `mainlayout.py` to allow users to adjust these parameters.
    *   Ensure these parameters are correctly passed to the OpenEvolve backend via `openevolve_integration.py`.

2.  **Real-time progress visualization:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to receive real-time updates from OpenEvolve regarding the evolution progress (e.g., current generation, best fitness, average fitness). This might involve modifying `openevolve_integration.py` to poll for updates or setting up a websocket connection.
    *   Display this information dynamically in the frontend (e.g., progress bars, live charts) using `main.py` or `analytics_dashboard.py`.

3.  **Display detailed evolution results:**
    *   When an evolution run completes, fetch and display more comprehensive results from OpenEvolve. This could include:
        *   The best individual found (its parameters/genome).
        *   Fitness history over generations.
        *   Diversity metrics.
    *   Integrate these displays into `analytics_dashboard.py` or a dedicated results view.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features & User Experience

4.  **Support for different evolutionary algorithms/strategies:**
    *   If OpenEvolve supports multiple algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary strategies), provide a way for users to select them in the UI.
    *   Adjust `openevolve_integration.py` to send the selected algorithm to the backend.

5.  **Checkpointing and resuming evolution runs:**
    *   Implement functionality to save the state of an evolution run (checkpoint) and resume it later. This would involve calls to OpenEvolve's API for checkpointing and loading.
    *   Add UI elements for "Save Checkpoint" and "Load Checkpoint."

6.  **Integration with OpenEvolve's artifact management:**
    *   If OpenEvolve generates artifacts (e.g., code, models, configurations), provide a way to view, download, or deploy these artifacts directly from the frontend.

7.  **Improved error handling and feedback:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for OpenEvolve API calls.
    *   Display user-friendly error messages and suggestions in the UI.

## Phase 3: Refinement & Testing

8.  **Unit and integration tests:**
    *   Write comprehensive tests for the new integration points and UI components.
    *   Ensure existing tests are updated or extended as needed.

9.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update user guides and technical documentation to reflect the new features and integration points.
