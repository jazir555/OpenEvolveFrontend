## Key Implementation Details

### Multi-Team AI Architecture
The enhanced implementation introduces a third AI team (Evaluator Team) that works alongside the Red Team (critics) and Blue Team (fixers). Each team can be configured with:

- Arbitrary number of team members
- Configurable sample sizes for each iteration
- Custom rotation strategies (Round Robin, Random Sampling, etc.)
- Per-model parameter settings (temperature, top-p, etc.)

### Configurable Acceptance Criteria
The evaluator team supports highly customizable acceptance criteria:

- Minimum score thresholds (e.g., 90.0%)
- Consecutive rounds requirements (e.g., 2 consecutive rounds)
- Judge participation requirements (e.g., 3/3 judges must participate)
- Consensus requirements (e.g., all judges must meet threshold)

### Keyword Analysis
Content can be enhanced with targeted keyword inclusion:

- Specify keywords that should be appropriately included
- Configure penalty weights for keyword presence/absence
- Analyze keyword density and distribution in evolved content
- Integrate keyword analysis with overall content scoring

### GitHub Integration
Final evolved content can be synchronized directly to GitHub repositories:

- Authentication with personal access tokens
- Repository and branch selection
- Commit with detailed messages
- One-click approval and sync from reports

### Comprehensive Reporting
Detailed analytics and reporting for all process phases:

- Performance metrics for all three teams
- Issue resolution tracking by severity
- Confidence trend analysis
- Cost and token usage breakdowns
- Keyword analysis reports
- Export in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX, JSON, etc.)

## Benefits of Enhanced Implementation

4. **Targeted Enhancement**: Keyword analysis for specific content requirements
5. **Seamless Integration**: Direct GitHub sync for workflow integration
6. **Comprehensive Analytics**: Detailed reporting and metrics for all process phases
7. **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent model selection based on content complexity and budget
8. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live progress tracking with detailed logs
