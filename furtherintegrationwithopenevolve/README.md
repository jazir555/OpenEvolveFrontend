# OpenEvolve Frontend

## Overview
OpenEvolve is a comprehensive AI-powered system for content evolution and adversarial testing. It implements a sophisticated multi-agent framework with Red Team (Critics), Blue Team (Fixers), and Evaluator Team (Judges) working together to improve content quality, security, and effectiveness through iterative adversarial testing and evolutionary optimization.

## Features
- **Content Analysis**: Deep semantic understanding and pattern recognition
- **Adversarial Testing**: Multi-layered red team/blue team critique and patching
- **Evolutionary Optimization**: Genetic algorithms for continuous content improvement
- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordination of multiple AI providers and models
- **Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive multi-dimensional quality evaluation
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic prompt generation and optimization
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, parallelization, and memory management
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible parameter and profile management

## Core Components

### 1. Content Analyzer (`content_analyzer.py`)
Analyzes input content structure, semantics, and patterns.

### 2. Prompt Engineering System (`prompt_engineering.py`)
Generates and manages dynamic prompts for various AI tasks.

### 3. Model Orchestration Layer (`model_orchestration.py`)
Coordinates multiple AI models and manages team workflows.

### 4. Quality Assessment Engine (`quality_assessment.py`)
Evaluates content quality across multiple dimensions.

### 5. Red Team (Critics) (`red_team.py`)
Identifies flaws, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses through adversarial testing.

### 6. Blue Team (Fixers) (`blue_team.py`)
Addresses issues identified by the Red Team with targeted fixes.

### 7. Evaluator Team (Judges) (`evaluator_team.py`)
Provides quality assessment and consensus building.

### 8. Evolutionary Optimization (`evolutionary_optimization.py`)
Implements genetic algorithms for content evolution.

### 9. Configuration System (`configuration_system.py`)
Manages system parameters and configuration profiles.

### 10. Quality Assurance (`quality_assurance.py`)
Implements quality gates and validation mechanisms.

### 11. Performance Optimization (`performance_optimization.py`)
Provides caching, parallelization, and other performance enhancements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download NLTK data:
   ```
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger'); nltk.download('wordnet'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"
   ```

## Usage

The system can be used in two main ways:

### 1. Library Usage
Import and use individual components in your Python code:
```python
from content_analyzer import ContentAnalyzer
from red_team import RedTeam
from blue_team import BlueTeam
from evaluator_team import EvaluatorTeam

# Analyze content
analyzer = ContentAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_content("Your content here")

# Perform adversarial testing
red_team = RedTeam()
red_assessment = red_team.assess_content("Your content here", "document")

# Apply fixes
blue_team = BlueTeam()
blue_assessment = blue_team.apply_fixes("Your content here", red_assessment.findings, "document")

# Evaluate quality
evaluator_team = EvaluatorTeam()
evaluation = evaluator_team.evaluate_content(blue_assessment.fixed_content, "document")
```

### 2. Streamlit UI (Coming Soon)
A web-based interface for easier interaction with the system.

## Testing

Run the integration tests to verify all components work together:
```
python integration_test.py
```
