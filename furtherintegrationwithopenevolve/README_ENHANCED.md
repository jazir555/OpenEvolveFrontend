# OpenEvolve: Fully Integrated Adversarial Testing + Evolution + Evaluation

## Overview

OpenEvolve is a cutting-edge platform that combines adversarial testing, evolutionary optimization, and expert evaluation to harden and optimize any content through AI-driven critique and refinement. The platform uses three distinct AI teams working together:

1. **üî¥ Red Team** - Finds flaws, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses
2. **üîµ Blue Team** - Fixes identified issues and improves content
3. **‚öñÔ∏è Evaluator Team** - Judges the fitness and correctness of evolved content

## Key Features

### Multi-Team AI Collaboration
- **Three AI Teams**: Red Team (critics), Blue Team (fixers), and Evaluator Team (judges)
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set acceptance criteria for the evaluator team (e.g., 9/10 from 3 judges for 2 consecutive rounds)
- **Arbitrary Team Sizes**: Configure any number of models for each team
- **Flexible Rotation Strategies**: Round Robin, Random Sampling, Performance-Based, Staged, Adaptive, and Focus-Category

### Enhanced Content Processing
- **Keyword Analysis**: Target specific keywords in evolved content with configurable penalties
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Optimize for complexity, diversity, and quality simultaneously
- **Content Type Awareness**: Specialized processing for code, legal documents, medical content, and more
- **Compliance Checking**: Built-in compliance requirement validation

### Advanced Controls
- **Granular Configuration**: Per-model temperature, top-p, frequency penalty, and presence penalty settings
- **Iteration Management**: Configurable minimum/maximum iterations, confidence thresholds, and stopping criteria
- **Budget Control**: Automatic model selection optimization based on content complexity and budget
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live progress tracking with detailed metrics and logs

### GitHub Integration
- **Direct Sync**: Approve and sync final evolved content directly to GitHub repositories
- **Branch Management**: Create and commit to specific branches
- **Commit History**: Track evolution through detailed commit messages

### Comprehensive Reporting
- **HTML Reports**: Rich, interactive reports with detailed metrics
- **Export Options**: PDF, DOCX, JSON, LaTeX, and compliance report formats
- **Performance Analytics**: Model performance comparisons and issue resolution tracking
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of API costs and token usage

## How It Works

### Three-Phase Process

1. **Adversarial Testing Phase**
   - Red Team models analyze content for flaws and vulnerabilities
   - Issues are categorized by severity and type
   - Confidence scores are calculated based on identified weaknesses

2. **Evolution Optimization Phase**
   - Blue Team models patch identified issues and improve content
   - Evolutionary algorithms optimize for multiple objectives
   - Content quality is enhanced through iterative refinement

3. **Evaluation Judging Phase**
   - Evaluator Team models judge the fitness and correctness of evolved content
   - Configurable acceptance thresholds must be met for 1-N consecutive rounds
   - Final approval requires consensus from selected evaluator models

### Configurable Acceptance Criteria

The evaluator team supports highly customizable acceptance criteria:

- **Threshold Setting**: Define minimum score requirements (e.g., 90.0%)
- **Consecutive Rounds**: Require multiple rounds of consistent high scores
- **Judge Count**: Specify how many evaluator models must participate
- **Consensus Requirements**: Define how many judges must meet threshold

Example: "Require 3/3 evaluator judges to score 9/10 for 2 consecutive rounds"

### Keyword Analysis

Enhance evolved content with targeted keyword inclusion:

- **Target Keywords**: Specify keywords that should be appropriately included
- **Penalty Weights**: Configure importance of keyword inclusion
- **Analysis Reports**: Detailed breakdown of keyword presence and density
