# Task: Fix all blank tabs in the Streamlit application.

## Progress:

### Part 1: Calling the render functions for each tab
- [x] Read the full content of `mainlayout.py`.
- [x] Identified the `st.tabs` creation in `render_main_layout`.
- [x] **NEW**: Identified a structural issue where `with tabs[X]:` blocks are duplicated and some are outside the main rendering `else` block. This is the primary cause of blank tabs.

### Part 2: Implementing placeholder functionality
- [x] **Analytics Dashboard Tab**:
    - [x] Check for `psutil` in `requirements.txt`.
    - [x] Implement resource utilization monitoring.
    - [x] Implement "Generate Evolution Report" button functionality.
    - [x] Implement "Generate Model Comparison Report" button functionality.
    - [x] Implement "Export All Data" button functionality.
- [x] **OpenEvolve Dashboard Tab**:
    - [x] Replace simulated "Performance Over Time" chart with a real-time chart using session state data.
- [x] Review other tabs for any placeholder-like messages and implement them.

### Part 3: Structural Refactoring to fix blank tabs
- [ ] **Consolidate Tab Content**:
    - [ ] For `tabs[3]` (Activity Feed) through `tabs[10]` (OpenEvolve Orchestrator):
        - [ ] Move the content from the *later, more extensive* `with tabs[X]:` blocks into their corresponding `render_*_tab()` functions.
        - [ ] Remove the redundant `with tabs[X]:` blocks from the end of `render_main_layout()`. This includes the `with tabs[8]` and `with tabs[9]` blocks that contain the more extensive analytics and openevolve dashboard implementations.
    - [ ] Ensure that the `else` block in `render_main_layout()` correctly calls the now-updated `render_*_tab()` functions for all tabs from `tabs[1]` to `tabs[10]`.
    - [ ] Verify the content for `tabs[0]` (Evolution) is correctly rendered within its `with tabs[0]:` block in the `else` statement.
