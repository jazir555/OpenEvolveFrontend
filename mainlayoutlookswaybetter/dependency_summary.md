   - Successfully creates Word documents

## Dependency Installation Process

### Virtual Environment Creation
A clean virtual environment was created to test the installation process:
```bash
python -m venv openevolve_test_env
```

### Dependency Installation
All dependencies were successfully installed using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The installation process completed without errors, downloading and installing all required packages and their dependencies.

## Compatibility Verification

### Version Compatibility
All installed package versions are compatible with each other:
- Streamlit 1.49.1 works correctly with all other packages
- Requests 2.32.5 is compatible with current HTTP standards
- All other packages are at versions that work well together

### Functional Testing
Each dependency was tested for proper functionality:
- Streamlit components render correctly
- HTTP requests execute successfully
- Tag inputs work as expected
- PDF and DOCX generation functions properly

## Optional Dependencies

No additional optional dependencies were identified during the analysis. All required functionality is covered by the five main dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

## Virtual Environment for Testing

A dedicated virtual environment (`openevolve_test_env`) was created and configured for testing purposes. This ensures:
- Clean separation from system-wide Python packages
- Reproducible installation process
- Isolated testing environment
- Easy recreation for new developers

## Installation Instructions

The installation process is straightforward and documented:

1. **Create virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv openevolve_env
   openevolve_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dependency Analysis Results

### Package Imports
All required packages import successfully without conflicts:
```python
import streamlit
import requests
import streamlit_tags
import fpdf
import docx
```
