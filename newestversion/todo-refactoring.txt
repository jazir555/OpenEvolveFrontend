# Dependency Injection System Refactoring Plan

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
- [ ] Audit all current static classes to identify dependencies and coupling points and notate them in a text file
- [ ] Document current architecture flaws and tight coupling issues
- [ ] Map out dependency relationships between classes
- [ ] Identify external dependencies (WordPress functions, globals, etc.)
- [ ] Create dependency matrix showing class interdependencies
- [ ] Assess which classes can be easily refactored vs. which need major rework

## Phase 2: Core Architecture Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor ServiceContainer to be a proper DI container (not just a wrapper)
- [ ] Remove redundant manager wrapper classes
- [ ] Convert static classes to instantiable injectable classes
- [ ] Extract configuration and make it injectable
- [ ] Replace direct WordPress function calls with injectable adapters
- [ ] Implement proper constructor injection throughout

## Phase 3: Individual Class Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor Ajax class to be injectable (remove static methods)
- [ ] Refactor AssetActionHandler class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor AssetData class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor AssetOrder class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor AssetUtils class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor AssetValidator class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Cache class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Cleanup class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Database class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Enqueue class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Extract class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor FileLock class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Generate class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor GetData class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor GetOption class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Initialize class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Normalize class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Process class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Render class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Replace class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Retry class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Scanner class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor SelfHost class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Settings class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Speculation class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor SVG class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor Tasks class to be injectable
- [ ] Refactor UrlProcessor class to be injectable

## Phase 4: Dependency Extraction
- [ ] Create HttpClientInterface and implementations (WordPress adapter, mock for testing)
- [ ] Create FilesystemInterface and implementations (WordPress adapter, mock for testing)
- [ ] Create DatabaseInterface and implementations (WordPress adapter, mock for testing)
- [ ] Create LoggerInterface and implementations (FileLogger, NullLogger for testing)
- [ ] Create CacheInterface and implementations (WordPress transients, memory cache, mock)
- [ ] Create WordPressAdapter classes for core WordPress functions
- [ ] Extract configuration management to injectable service
- [ ] Create EventDispatcherInterface for decoupling event handling

## Phase 5: Interface Refinement
- [ ] Simplify overly complex interfaces (many current interfaces have 50+ methods)
- [ ] Apply Interface Segregation Principle - split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Ensure interfaces follow Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] Create meaningful, focused interfaces that represent actual roles
- [ ] Remove interfaces that don't provide real value or abstraction

## Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up PHPUnit testing framework
- [ ] Create base test classes with proper mocking capabilities
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for tests
- [ ] Create fixture data for testing
- [ ] Set up test databases and filesystem mocks
- [ ] Implement continuous integration testing

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies in refactored classes
- [ ] Add lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize service container compilation and caching
- [ ] Profile performance before and after refactoring
- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring and optimization

## Phase 8: Documentation and Migration
- [ ] Document new architecture and class responsibilities
- [ ] Create migration guide for developers using the system
- [ ] Update code examples and usage documentation
- [ ] Create API reference for new injectable classes
- [ ] Provide backward compatibility layer during transition

## Phase 9: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests for all refactored classes
- [ ] Add integration tests for key workflows
- [ ] Perform security auditing of refactored code
- [ ] Conduct performance benchmarking
- [ ] Ensure full code coverage for critical functionality

## Phase 10: Deployment and Monitoring
- [ ] Plan gradual rollout strategy
- [ ] Implement feature flags for new architecture
- [ ] Set up monitoring for performance and error metrics
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Monitor production performance post-deployment

## Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)
- [ ] Remove redundant manager wrapper classes
- [ ] Simplify overly complex interfaces
- [ ] Extract configuration to injectable service
- [ ] Create basic HTTP client adapter
- [ ] Set up initial testing framework

## Long-term Goals
- [ ] Achieve full test coverage
- [ ] Implement proper design patterns (Strategy, Observer, etc.)
- [ ] Enable easy extensibility and customization
- [ ] Achieve measurable performance improvements
- [ ] Reduce overall code complexity and coupling
